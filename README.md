## Setup

[instructions for following along locally using your preferred text editor
](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment)

## Build and run

> npm install

> npm start

Install Typescript (globally) for running TS files

> npm install -g typescript

After this, if you run `tsc`, it will create the **built/** directory where it will generate all the *.js/.jsx* files.

**N.B. For a big React project, we use Babel to run that `tsc` everytime. That needs to be set in <>**
